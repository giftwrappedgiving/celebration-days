# celebration-days

A dataset of celebration and awareness days â€” starting with those focused on books, reading, literacy, and libraries ðŸ“šâœ¨

## What's in here?

This repository contains:
- `schema.md` â€” the data structure and field definitions.
- `celebration-day.csv` â€” the dataset of celebration days with key details like dates (or rules if the date isn't fixed), organisations, hashtags, and audiences.

The goal is to provide a clean, reusable dataset for anyone planning content, events, or campaigns around important days.

## Fields captured in the dataset
Each record in `celebration-day.csv` includes:
- `reference` â€” unique ID for the day
- `name` â€” name of the celebration day
- `description` â€” what itâ€™s all about
- `countries` â€” where itâ€™s observed
- `categories` â€” themes like literacy, books, libraries
- `date-type` â€” `fixed` or `dynamic`
- `event-date` â€” fixed date (if applicable, format: MM-DD)
- `date-rule` â€” rule for dynamic dates (e.g., "First Thursday in March")
- `first-date` â€” year it started
- `organisation` â€” who runs or recognises it
- `url` â€” official link
- `hashtags` â€” common social tags
- `audience-types` â€” who itâ€™s aimed at
- `notes` â€” anything else useful

See `schema.md` for full definitions.
